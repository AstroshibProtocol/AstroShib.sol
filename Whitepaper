AstroShib Ecosystem: A super deflationary mega yield-generating project on the Binance Smart Chain inspired by Safemoon and Shiba inu tokens innovations. 

Abstract
The AstroShib Protocol is a community driven, focused and super deflationary ecosystem DeFi token protocol. AstroShib Protocol as closely related to both Shiba Inu and SafeMoon originally started in 2018 and has since adopted the innovations of both parent projects Shiba Inu and SafeMoon. The ecosystem aims to become the most utilized platform for diverse Defi projects in the rapidly growing cryptoverse with it's combination of yield farming, decentralized financing and deflationary model. The AstroShib Protocol aims to solve the problems of prior cryptocurrencies including mining and liquidity provision. Mining equipments are both expensive and harmful to the environment but earning mining rewards is of great interest to all crypto communities. The AstroShib Ecosystem also aims to evolve into a much needed and sort after bridge for interoperability between the real world and the cryptoverse. Since the inception of smart contracts, developers have been tasked with providing a suitable way for liquidity provision to fuel exchange of coins/tokens on decentralized exchanges which lead to developers creating incentives aimed at users to provide liquidity, but this too poses a greater risk due to the subjectivity of impermanent loss and thus liquidity providers may loss value if this happens and hereby discourage intended liquidity providers. Therefore, as an inter-connected improvement on both yield farming tokens(e.g Shiba inu decentralized platform = ShibaSwap) and innovative deflationary tokens (e.g SafeMoon Protocol), we propose providing users the opportunity to participate in a smart contract token reflection to generate passive income and also benefit from constant deflation of the token supply over time through a burning mechanism implemented in the smart contract and a constant burn model to be implemented on all AstroShib products. This is made possible by utilizing a smart contract function to automatically generate liquidity to be used in decentralized exchanges and this liquidity is held in custody independent from users possession. Additionally, the smart contract is developed to automatically burn a portion of the reflections on each trade by automatically allocating a portion of the token to a burn wallet address where the tokens are destroyed forever and removed from circulation thereby drastically reducing the token total supply. 

The AstroShib Ecosystem aims to provide users various benefits that will enhance the further development of the AstroShib Ecosystem into a power house in the cryptoverse and foster trust and cross-chain utility across the cryptoverse. 


OUR BACKGROUND

Our ecosystem has been in planning phase since 2018 but the launch of the project was ignited by the innovations of both Shiba Inu and SafeMoon which introduced to the cryptoverse a new concept of decentralization. We are a community driven, focused and super deflationary ecosystem DeFi token protocol with 55% of the token total supply allocated to the public( AstroShibArmy ) and 40% initially burnt to a burn wallet address thereby making the AstroShibArmy own 91% of the circulaing token supply, making the AstroShib Ecosystem even more decentralized. We are an innovative focused community that is solely focused on providing the cryptoverse habitats the opportunity to better the world through blockchain innovations and decentralization.



WHY ADOPT BOTH SHIBA INU & SAFEMOON APPROACH TO DECENTRALIZATION?

The AstroShib community at large is the home for all communities in the cryptoverse and as such, we have adopted both the innovations by SHIBA INU & SAFEMOON to secure a brighter future for mass adoption and utilization in the cryptoverse. This combined approach will help the AstroShib Ecosystem to develop a truly unique and innovative future for cryptocurrencies since it's inception by Satoshi Nakamoto( Bitcoin founder ) in 2009 and the quest for mass adoption and utility has since lead to the evolution of Ethereum(first defi ecosystem), Dogecoin(first meme coin) and SafeMoon(first reflection token).


HOW ASTROSHIB PROTOCOL WORKS?

A 10% fee is charged for trading the AstroShib token whereby existing holders earn 3% in reflections, 2% is burnt automatically and 5% is automatically added to the liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges. The AstroShib token is also the most deflationary token on the Binance Smart Chain with it's super deflationary structure.


WHY BINANCE SMART CHAIN?

We decided to deploy the AstroShib token on the Binance Smart Chain because of it's extremely low transaction fees and relatively faster TPS unlike the Ethereum Blockchain which has way more higher fees and lower TPS.

TOKENOMICS 

The AstroShib Ecosystem token is the first super deflationary mega yield-generating project on the Binance Smart Chain.  A combination of SafeMoon and Shiba Inu. A total of 10% tax is charged for every buy and sell of the AstroShib token. 


■ 3% is automatically reflected to all holders 

■ 5% is automatically added to the liquidity pool 

■ 2% is burnt automatically
