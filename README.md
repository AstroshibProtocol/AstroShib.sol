astroshib contract 

Astroshib protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. 
The AstroShib Ecosystem is originally the idea of a young African technology educator and enthusiasts " Oscar Adaka " who saw the need to build an ecosystem that is able to integrate various sectors of the modern day economy into decentralized finance(Defi) and enable passive income generation(reflection) for Africans through a totally decentralized ecosystem. The AstroShib token and ecosystem has been in planning phase since 2018 but the launch of the project was ignited by the innovations of both Shiba Inu and SafeMoon which introduced to the cryptoverse a new concept to decentralization. We are a community driven, focused and super deflationary ecosystem DeFi token protocol with 40% of our initial token supply burnt(destroyed) and this amount will continue to diminish fast on every trade of the ASTROSHIB Token due to our tokenomics deflationary structure. We are an innovative focused community that is solely focused on providing the cryptoverse habitats, the opportunity to better the world through blockchain innovations and decentralization in everyday activities.
